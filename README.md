# Optoelectronics

*Optoelectronics systems simulations*, Sep 2019 - Sep 2020

This repository contains various files and reports regarding optoelectronics systems simulations. 
Those works were implemented as part of my own laboratory studies at Keio University (Japan).
Each file contains MATLAB simulations and a complete reports of the case study.

More precisely :

* Report 1 deals with laser diode and optical transistors
* Report 2 deals with optical diffraction light propagation
* Report 3 optical fibers simulations and effects in networks

## Results

### Laser diode and optical transistors
